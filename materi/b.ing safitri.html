    <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
        <p>Waste is the residue of an activity or production that has no economic value. Waste can be a solid, liquid, or gas produced by human activity or natural processes. There are various types of waste based on their form, source, and natural composition. Waste types based on their source include industrial, domestic, agricultural, and medical waste. Furthermore, waste is classified based on its composition, namely organic and inorganic waste. In this article, I will explain paper waste.</p>
        <p>Paper waste is the remaining materials or products made from paper that are no longer used and discarded. This waste comes from various sources, such as households, offices, printing industries, and others. There are various types of paper waste, this waste is categorized based on its source and characteristics. There are types of paper waste based on its source, namely industrial paper waste, office paper waste, household paper waste, and commercial paper waste. In addition, there are types of paper waste based on its characteristics, namely newsprint, cardboard, HVS paper, glossy paper, and mixed paper. The types of paper are very diverse, each designed for a specific use. Paper can be distinguished based on weight, texture, coating, and manufacturing materials.</p>
        <p>Paper specifications can vary based on color, use, and shape. Paper colors are not limited to white; paper is available in a variety of colors, from soft pastels to bright and dark colors. Paper materials are very diverse, ranging from wood pulp to recycled fibers, cotton, linen, and even synthetic materials. Paper uses are very diverse, there is writing paper for writing and printing documents, drawing paper for drawing, and many more uses of paper. Paper forms also vary, from standard sheets (A4, letter, legal) to rolls, envelopes, cards, and other special shapes.</p>
        <p>Utilizing paper waste is an important topic in environmental conservation efforts and reducing the negative impact of waste. If not managed properly, paper waste can pollute the environment and contribute to global problems such as deforestation. Therefore, it is important to understand the various ways to utilize paper waste. Paper waste can also be used to create various handicrafts. I tried making a woven bag from paper waste.</p>
